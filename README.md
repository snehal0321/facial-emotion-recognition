🚀 Facial Emotion Recognition (Hackathon Project)

An AI-powered system that detects human emotions (like Happy, Sad, Angry, etc.) from facial images.
This project is built to demonstrate the use of Machine Learning in Human-Computer Interaction.

🔎 Tech Stack:

TensorFlow & Keras (CNN model)
Streamlit (Web App Interface)
Python, NumPy, OpenCV, Pillow

🎯 Features:

Upload an image and detect the emotion in real-time
Shows predicted emotion + confidence score
Trained on the FER2013 dataset (7 emotions)
Light-weight model using CNN, easy to deploy

🎥 Demo Video:


💡 Why This Project?

Facial Emotion Recognition can be applied in:
Online learning platforms (detect student engagement)
Customer feedback analysis
Healthcare (monitor patient mood/emotions)
Gaming and interactive entertainment

📂 Project Structure

/app.py                # Streamlit App
/model.h5              # Trained model
/notebooks/train_model.ipynb  # Training notebook
/requirements.txt      # Package dependencies

🚀 How to Run

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py

🚀 Future Work

Add live webcam emotion detection
Expand to more emotion classes (using AffectNet)
Deploy the app on Streamlit Cloud for public use
